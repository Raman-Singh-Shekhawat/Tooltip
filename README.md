# Frontend App using React.js

● This frontend app renders a tooltip which is built and positioned without using any additional libraries. 

● It provides a real-time preview of a mobile screen with button elements, where the buttons are target elements for the tooltips to be rendered.

● Users can set the target element and style and change the text of the tooltip.

● Users can also edit the background, text size and padding of the target elements which are the buttons in this case.


# Please Note:

● The tooltip functionality is under development. However, upon hovering over the button(s), the tooltip shall be visible.

● As soon as the functionality is fully functional, the developer will remove this section of the README (i.e. lines 12-16).
